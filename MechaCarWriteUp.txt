MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSIS OF FUEL EFFICIENCY

This analysis uses the MechaCar_mpg.csv file, which contains fifty observations, each with six variables. The fuel efficiency variable, represented in the script by $mpg, is considered the dependent value. The first step undertaken in the analysis was to create and correlate a matrix of the variable columns. See below:

Fuel Efficiency Correlation Matrix 
	                 vehicle_length vehicle_weight spoiler_angle ground_clearance         AWD         mpg	vehicle_length       1.00000000    -0.12271790    0.02577114      -0.31663112  0.08565668  0.60947984	vehicle_weight      -0.12271790     1.00000000   -0.11307851       0.08511338 -0.03698098  0.09068314	spoiler_angle        0.02577114    -0.11307851    1.00000000      -0.21112057 -0.09120266 -0.02083999	ground_clearance    -0.31663112     0.08511338   -0.21112057       1.00000000 -0.15214456  0.32874886	AWD                  0.08565668    -0.03698098   -0.09120266      -0.15214456  1.00000000 -0.14166977	mpg                  0.60947984     0.09068314   -0.02083999       0.32874886 -0.14166977  1.00000000

As mpg is the dependent variable, that column is the only being considered. Most variables show some correlation, with the most promising correlatives being vehicle_length and ground_clearance, with positive correlation of approximately 0.609 and 0.328, respectively. It is assumed at this point that these two variables will be present in the multiple linear regression.

The next step undertaken was running a multiple linear regression on all variables, again, with mpg as the dependent variable and the remaining five as independent. In this first run, the coefficients are:

	(Intercept): 		-1.040e+02                           	vehicle_length: 	6.267e+00    
	vehicle_weight;		1.245e-03
	spoiler_angle:		6.877e-02	
	ground_clearance:	3.546e+00
	AWD:			-3.411e+00

Using this as a multiple linear regression, the model could be expressed as:
 	mpg = -104 +  6.267(vehicle_length) + 0.001245(vehicle_weight) + 0.06877(spoiler_angle) + 3.546(ground_clearance) - 3.411(AWD)

This data tells use that vehicle_weight and spoiler_angle have relatively low (i.e., slopes close to zero) correlation with fuel efficiency, whereas the remainder of the variables (Intercept excluded) all seem to have high correlation.

An analysis of the p-values for each will provide the probability that the variables are actually correlated. The entire multiple linear regression was placed input the summarize() function. The p-values and significance are provide below:

	                  Pr(>|t|)    	(Intercept)       5.08e-08 ***	vehicle_length    2.60e-12 ***	vehicle_weight    0.0776 .  	spoiler_angle     0.3069    	ground_clearance  5.21e-08 ***	AWD               0.1852    
	Signif. codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1

Here, it is evident that, of the variables, only for the variables for vehicle_length and ground_clearance is the p-value low enough to reject the null hypothesis that the effect is random. As such, we accept the alternate hypothesis for each that the variables of vehicle_length and ground_clearance to impact fuel efficiency.

To develop a better multiple linear regression model, then, the same procedure will be run with only the variables that are significant. The coefficients are as follow:

	(Intercept): 		-91.557                           	vehicle_length: 	6.081    	
	ground_clearance:	3.567

The summary analysis renders the following p-values, all of which are still significant: 

	                  Pr(>|t|)    	(Intercept)       3.86e-08 ***	vehicle_length    7.68e-12 ***	ground_clearance  3.26e-08 ***	Signif. codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1


The resultant multiple linear regression model for this data, which may have some predictive power is, therefore:

	mpg = -91.557 + 6.081(vehicle length) + 3.567(ground_clearance)


SUMMARY STATISTICS MODEL AND T-TEST

The pressure of the suspension coil is considered in this following analysis, where the idea mean, mu, is 1500psi. The first summary analysis was performed on the entire dataset while a second analysis was performed on the data grouped by Manufacturing Lot number. All data are presented in the following table, along with the p-value for the single set t-test, which should indicate if the sample is statistically similar:

  	Manufacturing_Lot   Mean_PSI   Median_PSI   Variance   Standard_Deviation   p-value  	Entire Dataset      1499.531     1499.747   76.23459             8.731242    0.5117 	Lot1                1500.        1500.       1.15                1.07  	     0.9048 	Lot2                1500.        1499.      10.1                 3.18 	     0.3451 	Lot3                1499.        1498.     220.                 14.8         0.637

The p-values for the whole sample and all Manufacturing Lots are all well about 0.05, meaning there is not sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis that there is no statistical difference between the observed sample and the presumed population mean. This means we can assume the samples are statistically similar. The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the coils must not exceed 100psi. With a variance of approximately 76.235, the dataset as a whole, it would appear that the full sample would fit within that specification. However, drilling down, it is noted that Manufacturing Lot 3 has a variance of 220., which far exceeds the specifications. 

Summary data for just Manufacturing Lots 1 and 2 is provided:

  	Manufacturing_Lot   Mean_PSI   Median_PSI   Variance   Standard_Deviation   p-value	Lots 1 and 2        1499.795     1499.995   5.632336             2.373254.   0.3888

The first two manufacturing lots fall within the design specification and the p-value of this single-set t-test, at 0.3888, is higher than 0.05, so the evidence to reject the null hypothesis is lacking and it is, thus, accepted that the Lots 1 and 2 sample is statistically similar.
